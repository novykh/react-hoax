# React Hoax

Idiomatic resourceful context.

## Installation

React Hoax requires **React 16.8.3 or later.**

```
npm install --save react-hoax
```

This assumes that you’re using [npm](http://npmjs.com/) package manager with a module bundler like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) or [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) to consume [CommonJS modules](https://webpack.js.org/api/module-methods/#commonjs).

If you don’t yet use [npm](http://npmjs.com/) or a modern module bundler, and would rather prefer a single-file [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) build that makes `react-hoax` available as a global object, you can grab a pre-built version from [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/react-hoax). We _don’t_ recommend this approach for any serious application, as most of the libraries complementary to React Hoax are only available on [npm](http://npmjs.com/).

Enjoy!
